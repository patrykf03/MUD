# The MUD Project

## Warning
**The entire project is untested, use at your own risk and look over whether its not broken beforehand.**

<br/>
The Multiple Universal Daughterboard project is a series of pcb's I've designed to have replaceable modules with microcontrollers.

There are 2 modules based on STM32F411 and nRF microcontrollers.

They can be integrated either by putting an M.2 connector directly on the pcb or connected from a daughterboard over a 30 pin flat ribbon connector.

There are 2 daughterboards currently available.

* Full daughterboard
  * Uses usb C
  * Has a usb Hub with 2 usb A outputs
  * Has an optional magnetic i2c connector
* Simple daughterboard
  *  The same as the full daughterboard but without an integrated hub.
